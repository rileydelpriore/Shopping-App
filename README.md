Project Proposal

For our project, we want to create an online marketplace where Colgate students can buy, sell, and browse clothes. Some features of our project will include a page where listed items can be browsed and added to their cart, an upload page where users can upload their clothes as item listings, a profile page where users can view their listed, sold, and bought items, a cart page where users can view and remove the items they have put in their cart, and a checkout page where users can purchase items, adding in their payment and delivery information. Some of the models we will need to create include an item model with the attributes description, size, sale price, original price, and condition, an authentication model with email, username, and password attributes, a cart model with an item list and total price attributes, a checkout model with shipping and payment attributes, and a browsing model with an items list attribute. Other models we may create include a customer model and an availability model. The team members for this project are Chase, Riley, and Annie.
